# Hardik-s-world
# 🧪 Temporary Code Writing Repository

This repository is a personal space for experimenting, testing, and drafting Python code. It's not meant for production-level projects, but rather for quick idea implementation, practice, and storing snippets that may evolve into something more later.

## 🧰 What You’ll Find Here

- Draft scripts
- Small practice programs
- Debug tests
- Snippet storage
- One-off utility code

## 💻 Languages & Tools

- **Python 3.x**
- VS Code (preferred editor)
- Optional use of:
  - `pyttsx3` for text-to-speech
  - `difflib` for fuzzy matching
  - `os`, `random`, etc., as needed

## 🔍 Why This Repo Exists

Because not every idea needs a full project yet. This repo helps keep all small experiments in one place and makes it easier to:
- Revisit old code
- Reuse snippets
- Push quick backups
- Share temporary ideas if needed

## 📁 Folder Structure (Optional)
